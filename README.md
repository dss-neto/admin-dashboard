# Project: Admin Dashboard

The goal of this project is to enhance front-end abilities, using Grid and Flexbox together to build an eye-candy layout.

## Description

The layout is similar to Trello, with card based content layed in grids.
There are no JavaScript interactions, since it isn't the main goal of this project. They may be added as extra content in the future though.
